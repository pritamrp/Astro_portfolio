After Anthropic's recent release of their findings on interpreting large language models, OpenAI has also published their research in this area, focusing on both GPT-2 and GPT-4 models.

Interpreting these black-box models is crucial to prevent jailbreaking, malicious use, and unintended consequencesâ€”similar to Google's Generative Search Experience mistakenly suggesting adding glue to make pizza cheesier. 

Both Anthropic and OpenAI recognize the importance of decoding the behavior of large language models and have taken significant steps to achieve this.

Their studies employ an unsupervised approach using sparse autoencoders to understand neural activations within the models. This method allows researchers to gain insights into how language models process and generate text.

I found the Anthropic study particularly insightful. For a detailed exploration, you can read the full articles here:
